# AuthJazz
This is a multi-auth plugin system.

## Development
Development is simple.
 * We use Prettier to style everything.
 * Jest for testing, supertest available to test server.
 * Flow type notations.
 * Any frontend managed with React.
 * Node Express and Sequelize sql bindings.

0. Write tests, run tests with `yarn test`. `yarn test:cov` gives a coverage report. `yarn test -- --watch` keeps it running.
0. `yarn start` starts server, information in console. Coloured output for readability.
